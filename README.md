# Budworm Addiction Modeling Framework

This repository contains a collection of ecological and social simulation models implemented in Python. Originally inspired by R-based models, this framework has been restructured into a modular Python package. It focuses on population dynamics, bifurcation behavior, and socially-influenced phenomena.

---

## 🐛 Overview

The Budworm Modeling Framework explores:
- **Ecological dynamics**: Simulating spruce budworm population changes with predator-prey interactions.
- **Bifurcation analysis**: Visualizing multiple population steady states across predator strength.
- **Social mechanisms**: Modeling how social behavior influences ecological outcomes (e.g., bird predation), or simulating collective phenomena like protests or behavior adoption.
- **Behavioral transitions**: Simulating how people switch between smoking, vaping, dual use, or abstention.

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jesse291847/Budworm-modeling-framework.git
cd Budworm-addiction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Each script in `models/` can be run independently or imported into a notebook. For example:

```bash
python models/budworm_model.py
```

### Or use the demo notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/budworm_model_demo.ipynb
```

## 📘 Model Descriptions

### 🔹 `budworm_model.py`
- Core logistic population growth with predation.
- Based on classic spruce budworm dynamics.

### 🔹 `bifurcation_triple.py`
- Sweeps over predator strength `B` to produce a bifurcation diagram.
- Visualizes multiple equilibria and sudden jumps in population.

### 🔹 `sigmoid_social_B.py`
- Introduces social feedback: collective action influences predator effectiveness.
- Predator strength `B` becomes a sigmoid function of budworm population.

### 🔹 `social_phenomena_sim.py`
- A threshold model where behavior (e.g., protesting, belief adoption) spreads once a tipping point is reached.

### 🔹 `vaping_and_smoking_sim.py`
- A behavior switching model: users can transition between smoking, vaping, both, or neither.
- Inspired by public health behavior models.

### 🔹 `budworm.py`
- 
- 

### 🔹 `N_over_t_with_sens.py`
